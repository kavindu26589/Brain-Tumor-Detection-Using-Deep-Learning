# Brain-Tumor-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for classifying brain MRI scans into four categories: No Tumor, Meningioma, Pituitary Tumor, and Glioma. It uses VGG16 transfer learning, data augmentation, and Keras Tuner for hyperparameter optimization, achieving high accuracy in medical imaging classification.
