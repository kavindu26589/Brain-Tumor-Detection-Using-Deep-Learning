# Brain-Tumor-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for classifying brain MRI scans into four categories: **No Tumor, Meningioma, Pituitary Tumor, and Glioma**. It uses **VGG16 transfer learning**, **data augmentation**, and **Keras Tuner** for hyperparameter optimization, achieving high accuracy in medical imaging classification.
